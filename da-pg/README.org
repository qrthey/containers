#+TITLE: Containers

* da-pg
  Helper scripts to build a postgres docker image that runs with
  danish collation and then start a container from that image binding
  a local volume to the container. Another container is started from
  the same image to connect a psql client to the previously created
  server.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    ./run-db some-database
  #+END_SRC

  Will create the `~/tmp/da-pg-dbs/db-some-database` directory if it
  doesn't exist, and bind it as the data-volume in the server
  container. This means that data can be kept between recreation of
  the containers.

  If you want to reset the database to a blank state, run the
  following.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    ./cleanup-db some-database
  #+END_SRC
